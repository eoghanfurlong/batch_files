# batch_files
Various batch files for organising/removing large quantities of files at once. I used these in the past to quickly process logfiles that were generated from hardware testing.

These will only work on Windows.

Some of the operations are recursive, so when deleting files don't run on the top level of any directory that may contain files in sub-directories that you don't want to destroy.
